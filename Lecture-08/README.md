# Exercises

## 1. Create a new table in PHPMyAdmin
- In PHPMyAdmin in the same DB as your "posts"-table -> Create a new table "comments" with the following fields:
  - id INT(10) PK 
  - post_id INT(10) FK 
  - content TEXT
  - author VARCHAR(100)
  - created_at TIMESTAMP CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

## 2. Extend the Post-API with CRUD for the table "comments"
- Add CRUD handling for the new table "comments" in the Post-API, as we did in the lesson for todo-API

## 3. Extend the Post-API, work with SQL Joins 
- Extend the SQL query for fetching specific post, by adding a JOIN between "posts" and "comments".
- The expected retrieved data is a post with all associated comments to a specific post
- Example on retrieved data from a specific post:

 - [GET]    http://localhost:3000/posts/:id
